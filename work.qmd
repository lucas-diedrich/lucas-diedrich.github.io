> My goal is to contribute to the understanding of the driving biological mechanisms of diseases in order to develop new cures, with a special fascination for our immune system. I am particuarly interested in combining existing public resources, mechanistic understanding of diseases and high throughput/omics data using computational methods to a more complete picture of the underlying causes.
