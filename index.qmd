Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Lucas. 

I am a student of biochemistry at Heidelberg University, currently working as a visiting student at the Shalek Lab in Boston. 
My interests lay in using computatinal approaches to better understand cellular biology in the context of diseases and cellular dysfunction (see also [Work](./work.qmd)). I am especially fascinated by omics technologies.
