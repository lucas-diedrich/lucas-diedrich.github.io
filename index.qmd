Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Lucas. 

I am a M.Sc. student of biochemistry at Heidelberg University, currently working as a visiting student at the Shalek Lab in Boston. 
I am interested in using computers to better understand cell biology in the context of disease and cellular dysfunction (see also [Work](./work.qmd)). I am particularly intrigued by the integration of omics technologies with prior biological knowledge.
