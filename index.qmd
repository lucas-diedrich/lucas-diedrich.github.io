Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Lucas. 

I am an incoming PhD student in computational biology at the [Mann Lab](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/mann) at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry. 
My goal is to use bioinformatics to better understand cell biology in the context of disease and cellular dysfunction. I am particularly interested in single-cell and spatial -omics (including metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, [$\rightarrow$ Work](./work.qmd)) and how we can leverage these highly resolved technologies to identify targets for novel therapies. I hope to contribute to these questions with open, accessible, and reproducible software.
