Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Lucas. 

I am a student of biochemistry at the University Heidelberg, currently working as a visiting student at the Shalek Lab in Boston. 

My interests lay in using computatinal approaches to better understand cellular biology in the context of diseases and cellular dysfunction.
