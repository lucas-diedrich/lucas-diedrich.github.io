Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Lucas. 

I am a student of biochemistry at the University Heidelberg, currently working as a visiting student at the Shalek Lab in Boston. 

My interests lay in using computatinal approaches to better understand cellular biology, especially our immune system in the context of diseases and cellular dysfunction.
